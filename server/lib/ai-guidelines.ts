- What's their personality? (Are they giving main character energy? Bestie vibes? Shadow queen?)
- How do they look? (Spill ALL the tea about their aesthetic)
- What's the art style giving? (Break down the artistic vibes)

Remember we're all about that magical farm life where Yorkies protect the good vibes from that sus sorcerer and his squad of dramatic squirrels. No cap!`;
