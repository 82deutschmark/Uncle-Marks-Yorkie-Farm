# Update: Handling Large .zip Files in Replit Object Storage

## Problem
- The Replit agent is experiencing issues when processing large .zip files.
- Bucket ID is already provided, but the storage system is optimized for individual file uploads (e.g., PNG files).

## Solution
1. Pre-Processing of .zip Files
   - Do not upload large .zip files directly.
   - Use a pre-deployment script to extract PNG files from each .zip file.
     - For example, in Node.js:
       ```
       const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');
       const fs = require('fs');
       const path = require('path');

       // Path to the input .zip file
       const zipFilePath = '/path/to/large.zip';

       // Initialize the zip extraction
       const zip = new AdmZip(zipFilePath);
       const zipEntries = zip.getEntries();

       zipEntries.forEach(entry => {
         if (entry.entryName.endsWith('.png')) {
           // Define the output path for the extracted PNG file
           const outputPath = path.join('/path/to/temp', entry.entryName);
           fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, entry.getData());
           // Call your upload function to upload the PNG to Replit Object Storage using the provided bucket ID.
           uploadPNGToBucket(outputPath);
         }
       });
       ```
     - Ensure that each PNG file is extracted and validated before upload.
     
2. Upload Process
   - For each extracted PNG file:
     - Upload the file individually to the designated bucket using the provided bucket ID.
     - Record a database entry for the image (metadata fields can be left blank initially).
     
3. Error Handling & Verification
   - Implement error checks in the extraction script:
     - Verify that the .zip file is successfully opened and each PNG file is extracted without corruption.
     - Log any errors related to extraction or file size issues.
   - Confirm that the uploaded PNG files appear correctly in Object Storage by cross-checking with the bucket ID.

## Notes
- This update ensures that the Replit agent deals with individual PNG files rather than handling a large .zip file directly.
- The pre-processing script can be integrated as part of the build or deployment process in your Replit project.
