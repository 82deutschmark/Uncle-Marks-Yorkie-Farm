Below is the updated technical specification reflecting the new "Generate Story" flow. When the user clicks the “Generate Story” button, the Replit‑hosted service will concurrently send out two requests—one to the OpenAI API to write a story and one to the MidJourney process (via Discord) to generate an image—and then return both outputs to your web app.

# Technical Specification: Story and Image Generation Integration

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**  
Create a backend service hosted on Replit that integrates with your existing web app. When the user clicks the “Generate Story” button, the service will:
- Send a request to the OpenAI API to generate a story based on provided input.
- Send a command (formatted as a Discord webhook message) to initiate MidJourney image generation.
- Capture the image URLs from the MidJourney output.
- Return both the generated story and image URLs to the web UI for display.

**Scope:**  
- Expose a RESTful API endpoint (e.g., `/api/generate-story`).
- Trigger two asynchronous processes:
  - **Story Generation:** Use the OpenAI API to produce a narrative.
  - **Image Generation:** Post a formatted `/imagine` command (with signature "Uncle Mark's Yorkie Farm") via Discord and capture the resulting image URLs.
- Combine both outputs and send them back to the web app.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **API Endpoint:**
  - Create an HTTP POST endpoint `/api/generate-story` that accepts a JSON payload (e.g., user prompt, additional parameters).
  
- **OpenAI API Integration:**
  - Upon receiving a request, forward the necessary data to the OpenAI API to generate a story.
  - Parse and capture the story text from the OpenAI API response.
  
- **MidJourney Command Posting:**
  - Format a command message as a plain text code block that starts with `/imagine` and appends the artist signature `"Uncle Mark's Yorkie Farm"`, incorporating the user’s prompt.
  - Post this message via the provided Discord webhook (`WEBHOOK_URL`).
  - Monitor the designated Discord channel for the MidJourney bot’s response and extract the image URL(s).

- **Response Aggregation:**
  - Once both processes complete (or timeout), return a JSON response containing:
    - The generated story text.
    - The image URL(s) from MidJourney.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - Execute the OpenAI and MidJourney processes concurrently to minimize overall latency.
  
- **Reliability:**
  - Implement error handling and logging for both API calls.
  - Include timeout and retry logic for network-related failures.
  
- **Security:**
  - Securely store all API keys and sensitive URLs in environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `WEBHOOK_URL`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`).
  
- **Maintainability:**
  - Write modular, well-documented code to facilitate future updates and enhancements.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Components
- **Replit Environment:**
  - Hosts the Python backend service.
  
- **API Service (Flask or FastAPI):**
  - Exposes the `/api/generate-story` endpoint.
  - Coordinates the execution of the two processes (story and image generation).

- **OpenAI Integration Module:**
  - Contains functions to call the OpenAI API and retrieve the generated story.

- **Discord Integration & Listener Module:**
  - Sends a formatted command to Discord via the webhook.
  - Runs a background listener (using `discord.py`) to capture the MidJourney bot’s response and extract image URLs.

- **Integration with Web UI:**
  - The web app (on the “Create a Yorkie” page) calls the `/api/generate-story` endpoint.
  - Displays the returned story and images to the user.

### 3.2 Data Flow Diagram
1. **User Action:**  
   - The user clicks the “Generate Story” button on the web UI.
   
2. **API Request:**  
   - The web app sends a POST request to `/api/generate-story` with prompt details.
   
3. **Concurrent Processing:**  
   - **OpenAI Request:** The service sends data to OpenAI and awaits a story response.
   - **MidJourney Request:** The service posts a formatted `/imagine` command to Discord via the webhook and waits for the MidJourney output.
   
4. **Output Capture:**  
   - The Discord listener monitors responses and extracts image URLs.
   
5. **Response Aggregation:**  
   - The service combines the story text and image URLs into a JSON response.
   
6. **Display:**  
   - The web app displays the story and image(s) to the user.

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Module Structure
- **main.py:**
  - Initializes the Flask (or FastAPI) app.
  - Defines the `/api/generate-story` endpoint.
  - Coordinates asynchronous calls to the OpenAI API and Discord command posting.
  
- **openai_client.py:**
  - Implements a function (e.g., `generate_story(prompt: str)`) to call the OpenAI API and return the story text.
  
- **discord_listener.py:**
  - Uses `discord.py` to connect to the designated Discord channel.
  - Contains a listener function to extract image URLs from MidJourney bot responses.
  
- **utils.py (Optional):**
  - Provides helper functions for logging, error handling, and message formatting.

### 4.2 Key Functions and Pseudocode

- **API Endpoint:**
  ```python
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
  from openai_client import generate_story
  from discord_listener import send_midjourney_command, get_image_urls
  import asyncio

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/api/generate-story', methods=['POST'])
  def generate_story_and_image():
      data = request.get_json()
      prompt_text = data.get('prompt_text', '')
      if not prompt_text:
          return jsonify({"error": "Prompt text is required."}), 400
      
      # Trigger both processes concurrently
      loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
      asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
      
      story_task = loop.run_in_executor(None, generate_story, prompt_text)
      image_task = loop.run_in_executor(None, send_midjourney_command, prompt_text)
      
      # Wait for both tasks to complete
      story_result = story_task.result(timeout=60)
      image_urls = get_image_urls(prompt_text)  # Implement polling or callback mechanism
      
      if not story_result or not image_urls:
          return jsonify({"error": "Failed to generate story or image."}), 500
      
      return jsonify({
          "status": "success",
          "story": story_result,
          "image_urls": image_urls
      }), 200

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
  ```

- **OpenAI Client (openai_client.py):**
  ```python
  import os, requests

  def generate_story(prompt: str) -> str:
      api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
      headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
      data = {
          "model": "text-davinci-003",
          "prompt": f"Write an engaging story about: {prompt}",
          "max_tokens": 500
      }
      response = requests.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions", headers=headers, json=data)
      if response.status_code == 200:
          story = response.json()["choices"][0]["text"].strip()
          return story
      else:
          print(f"OpenAI API error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
          return None
  ```

- **Discord Integration (discord_listener.py):**
  ```python
  import os, requests, asyncio
  from discord.ext import commands

  # Global dictionary or other structure to store image URLs per prompt if needed
  captured_image_urls = {}

  def send_midjourney_command(prompt: str) -> bool:
      webhook_url = os.environ.get("WEBHOOK_URL")
      command = f"```/imagine prompt: {prompt} \"Uncle Mark's Yorkie Farm\"```"
      payload = {"content": command}
      response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
      if response.status_code != 204:
          print(f"Error posting MidJourney command: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
          return False
      return True

  # Example listener setup (this may run in a separate process or thread)
  bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

  @bot.event
  async def on_message(message):
      # Check if message is from the MidJourney bot (customize criteria as needed)
      if message.author.bot and "imagine" in message.content.lower():
          urls = []
          for embed in message.embeds:
              if embed.image and embed.image.url:
                  urls.append(embed.image.url)
          for attachment in message.attachments:
              urls.append(attachment.url)
          # Store captured URLs; in a full implementation, correlate with a unique identifier
          captured_image_urls[message.id] = urls

  def get_image_urls(prompt: str, timeout: int = 30, interval: int = 2) -> list:
      # Simple polling mechanism: wait until at least one message with image URLs is captured
      elapsed = 0
      while elapsed < timeout:
          for urls in captured_image_urls.values():
              if urls:
                  return urls
          asyncio.sleep(interval)
          elapsed += interval
      return None

  def start_discord_listener():
      bot.run(os.environ.get("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"))
  ```

> **Note:** For production, consider a more robust correlation mechanism between the prompt sent and the response received (such as embedding a unique identifier in the command).

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Environment Setup
- Create a Python project on Replit.
- Set the following environment variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `WEBHOOK_URL` (Discord webhook URL)
  - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (for the Discord listener)

### 5.2 Dependency Installation
- Install necessary packages:
  ```bash
  pip install flask requests discord.py asyncio
  ```

### 5.3 Code Development
- Develop the API endpoint in `main.py` to trigger both processes.
- Implement the OpenAI client in `openai_client.py`.
- Implement the Discord listener and command posting in `discord_listener.py`.
- Ensure the Discord listener runs as a background task (e.g., using threading or Replit background tasks).

### 5.4 Testing and Deployment
- **Testing:**
  - Use Postman or curl to test the `/api/generate-story` endpoint.
  - Verify that the OpenAI API returns a story and that the Discord listener captures the image URLs.
- **Deployment:**
  - Enable Replit’s always-on feature to keep both the API and Discord listener running.
  - Monitor logs and refine the polling/waiting logic for output capture as needed.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **Correlation Improvements:**  
  - Embed a unique identifier in the command to directly associate the MidJourney response with the prompt.
  
- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  - Use WebSockets to push updates to the web UI as soon as image URLs are captured.
  
- **Persistent Storage:**  
  - Store generated stories and image URLs in a database for historical tracking and re-use.
